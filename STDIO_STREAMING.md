# Real-Time Command Output Streaming

## Overview
The CLI now streams command output in real-time to the console, allowing you to see the execution progress as it happens. This is especially useful for long-running commands or commands that produce output gradually.

## Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time Output Display**
- **stdout** is displayed with green prefix: `â”‚` 
- **stderr** is displayed with yellow prefix: `âš `
- Output appears immediately as the command produces it

### 2. **Visual Execution Feedback**
```
ðŸ“Ÿ Executing: echo "Hello World!"
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
â”‚ Hello World!
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
âœ“ Command completed successfully (exit code: 0)
```

### 3. **Exit Code Tracking**
- Shows success (âœ“) or failure (âœ—) with exit code
- Failed commands are clearly marked in red

## Examples

### Simple Command
When executing `echo "Hello World!"`:
```
============================================================
ðŸ“‹ NEW EXECUTION REQUEST
   Execution ID: exec-123
   Time: 10:45:32 AM
============================================================

  Executing single task...
  ðŸ“Ÿ Executing: echo "Hello World!"
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€

## Batch Processing

For batch tasks processing multiple items:
```
  Executing batch task...
  Processing batch of 3 items...

  ðŸ”¢ Item 1/3
  ðŸ“Ÿ Executing: echo "Hello World! Item 1"
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  â”‚ Hello World! Item 1
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  âœ“ Command completed successfully (exit code: 0)

  ðŸ”¢ Item 2/3
  ðŸ“Ÿ Executing: echo "Hello World! Item 2"
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  â”‚ Hello World! Item 2
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  âœ“ Command completed successfully (exit code: 0)
```

## Monitoring Tasks

For monitoring tasks with alert detection:
```
  Running monitoring checks...
  ðŸ“Ÿ Executing: echo "Hello World! - System Status: OK"
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  â”‚ Hello World! - System Status: OK
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  âœ“ Command completed successfully (exit code: 0)

  âœ… All checks passed
```

## Interactive Commands

The stdio configuration allows for:
- **stdin**: Inherited from parent process (allows interactive commands)
- **stdout**: Piped and streamed in real-time
- **stderr**: Piped and streamed in real-time

This means commands that require input can still work, while output is captured and displayed.

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Feedback**: See output as it happens, not after completion
2. **Better Debugging**: Clearly see what commands are running and their output
3. **Error Visibility**: stderr is highlighted differently from stdout
4. **Progress Tracking**: For long-running commands, see progress in real-time
5. **Exit Code Awareness**: Know immediately if a command succeeded or failed

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses Node.js `spawn` with:
- `shell: true` to support shell features (pipes, redirects, etc.)
- `stdio: ['inherit', 'pipe', 'pipe']` for proper I/O handling
- Event listeners on stdout/stderr streams for real-time output
- Exit code capture for success/failure determination

This ensures that all command output is visible immediately while still being captured for logging and status updates in the database.
